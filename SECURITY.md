## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you have identified a potential vulnerability, please follow these steps to help us address it promptly:

1. Do not disclose the issue publicly. Avoid reporting vulnerabilities through public channels like the issue tracker, forums, or social media.
2. Contact us directly: Please send an email to our security team at code@toneflix.com.ng with the following information:
   - A detailed description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept, if available.
   - Any relevant information, such as the software version and environment where the vulnerability was discovered.

We will respond as quickly as possible and work with you to resolve the issue. After addressing the vulnerability, we will acknowledge your contribution, if applicable, and may offer public credit with your consent.

## Security Process

1. Confirmation: Upon receiving a report, our security team will verify and assess the severity of the issue.
2. Resolution: We will prioritize and develop a fix, which may involve coordinating with affected parties if the vulnerability impacts multiple users.
3. Disclosure: We will publicly disclose the vulnerability, along with any patch or mitigation information, once the fix is available. Responsible disclosure is important to us, and we ask that you give us sufficient time to resolve issues before making them public.

Thank you for helping to keep our software secure.
